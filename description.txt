Special Thanks to:
direwolf420, darthmorf & jopojelly for a UIElement!

Features:
- A "clear chat" button. Clicking the trash icon will clear the input field.
- A color picker UI to add color tags using a color wheel.
- A item tag picker which lets you search for an item and add the corresponding chat tag.
- You can now use Ctrl+Alt (or AltGr) key combinations! So you are able to write some previously inaccessible symbols on some keyboard layouts.
